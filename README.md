## What is this?

Allows for New Campaign Trail modders to preview and export text meant for the "Further Reading" dialog.
You can do so in real time, your changes will appear on a live preview.

By default a template loads with examples of formatting possible, which you can clear.
The exporting process automatically formats the text as to work directly pasted into the `recommended-reading` tag in your Code 1.
